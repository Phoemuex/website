                    <h3> Research interests </h3>

                    I am interested in Functional analysis and Harmonic analysis, in particular in

                    <ul>
                        <li> Function spaces and their embeddings </li>
                        <li> Multiscale systems (wavelets, shearlets and generalizations) </li>
                        <li> Banach frames and atomic decompositions </li>
                        <li> Approximation theory, in particular the approximation properties of multiscale systems</li>
                        <li> Coorbit theory </li>
                        <li> Time-frequency analysis </li>
                        <li> Fourier analysis </li>
                    </ul>

                    As a mathematical hobby, I am interested in almost everything related to measure theory and in trying to crack toy problems
                    like <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1552990/is-it-possible-to-characterize-completeness-of-a-normed-vector-space-by-converge">this one</a> (which is solved by now).

                    <h3> Biography </h3>

                    <p> I am a Postdoctoral researcher in the Applied Functional Analysis group at TU Berlin, part of the group of Gitta Kutyniok. </p>

                    <p> I studied mathematics (Bachelor + Master) and computer science (Bachelor) at RWTH Aachen University, Germany, where I graduated with the Master degree with distinction in 2013.</p>

                    <p>As a Ph.D. student, I then joined the group of Hartmut FÃ¼hr at RWTH Aachen University, where I studied the approximation theoretic properties of different multiscale systems.
                    With my Ph.D. thesis <em>'Embedding Theorems for Decomposition Spaces with applications to Wavelet Coorbit Spaces'</em>, I graduated with distinction in November 2015.
                    In November 2016, I was awarded the <a href="http://www.mathematik.rwth-aachen.de/cms/Mathematik/Forschung/Auszeichnungen/~gskt/Friedrich-Wilhelm-Preis/?lidx=1">Friedrich-Wilhelm-Award 2016</a>
                    for my thesis.
                    </p>

                    <p> I highly enjoy teaching mathematics and am committed to explaining carefully and presenting the material in an enjoyable way.
                    At RWTH Aachen University, I have been teaching assistant for Analysis I and III, and for Harmonic analysis.
                    Therefore, I am very proud to have received the <a href="https://www.fsmpi.rwth-aachen.de/studium/lehrpreise/">Teaching award of the student council of mathematics at RWTH Aachen University</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>Since April 2016 I am a postdoctoral researcher at TU Berlin, where I am working on the <a href="http://dedale.cosmostat.org/">DEDALE</a> project.</p>
