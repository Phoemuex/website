                    <h3> Research interests </h3>

                    I am interested in Functional analysis and Harmonic analysis, in particular in

                    <ul>
                        <li>Function spaces and their embeddings</li>
                        <li>Multiscale systems (wavelets, shearlets and generalizations)</li>
                        <li>Banach frames and atomic decompositions</li>
                        <li>Neural networks and their properties, in particular their expressiveness and approximation properties</li>
                        <li>Coorbit theory</li>
                        <li>Approximation theory</li>
                        <li>Time-frequency analysis</li>
                        <li>Fourier analysis</li>
                    </ul>

                    As a mathematical hobby, I am interested in almost everything related to measure theory and in trying to crack toy problems
                    like <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1552990/is-it-possible-to-characterize-completeness-of-a-normed-vector-space-by-converge">this one</a> (which is solved by now).

                    <h3> Biography </h3>

                    <p> I am currently a Postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="http://www.ku.de/en/mgf/mathematik/lehrstuhlwissenschaftlichesrechnen/">Scientific Computing Group</a> at KU Eichst√§tt, part of the group of <a href="http://www.ku.de/?pfander">G√∂tz Pfander</a>. </p>

                    <p> I studied mathematics (Bachelor + Master) and computer science (Bachelor) at <a href="http://www.rwth-aachen.de/">RWTH Aachen University</a>, Germany, where I graduated with the Master degree with distinction in 2013.</p>

                    <p>As a Ph.D. student, I then joined the group of <a href="http://www.matha.rwth-aachen.de/en/mitarbeiter/fuehr/">Hartmut F√ºhr</a> at RWTH Aachen University, where I studied the approximation theoretic properties of different multiscale systems.
                    With my Ph.D. thesis <em>'Embedding Theorems for Decomposition Spaces with applications to Wavelet Coorbit Spaces'</em>, I graduated with distinction in November 2015.
                    In November 2016, I was awarded the <a href="http://www.mathematik.rwth-aachen.de/cms/Mathematik/Forschung/Auszeichnungen/~gskt/Friedrich-Wilhelm-Preis/?lidx=1">Friedrich-Wilhelm-Award 2016</a>
                    for my thesis.
                    </p>

                    <p> I highly enjoy teaching mathematics and am committed to explaining carefully and presenting the material in an enjoyable way.
                    At RWTH Aachen University, I have been teaching assistant for Analysis I and III, and for Harmonic analysis.
                    Therefore, I am very proud to have received the <a href="https://www.fsmpi.rwth-aachen.de/studium/lehrpreise/">Teaching award of the student council of mathematics at RWTH Aachen University</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>From April 2016 until January 2018, I was a postdoctoral researcher at TU Berlin in the group of <a href="https://www.math.tu-berlin.de/fachgebiete_ag_modnumdiff/angewandtefunktionalanalysis/v_menue/mitarbeiter/kutyniok/v_menue/home/">Gitta Kutyniok</a>, where I worked on the <a href="http://dedale.cosmostat.org/">DEDALE</a> project.
                    As part of that project, and with support by <a href="http://annepein.com/">Anne Pein</a>, I developed the <a href="https://github.com/dedale-fet/alpha-transform">DEDALE Œ±-shearlet transform</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>Since February 2018, I am part of the <a href="http://www.ku.de/en/mgf/mathematik/lehrstuhlwissenschaftlichesrechnen/">Scientific Computing Group</a> at KU Eichst√§tt.

                            <p>I just added to my list of publications two <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03576">new</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05289">preprints</a> that I recently uploaded to the arXiv.</p>
                            <p>
                            The first one establishes a rather general version of <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PricesTheorem.html">Price's theorem</a>: It gives a simple formula
                            for computing the partial derivatives of the map œÅ ‚Ü¶ ùîº[g(X·µ®)], where X·µ® is a normally distributed random variable with covariance matrix œÅ. Price published
                            this result in 1958, but did not precisely state the required assumptions on g. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03576">the paper</a>, I show that one
                            can in fact take every tempered distribution g.
                            This result is used in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04952">‚Ñì¬π-Analysis Minimization and Generalized (Co-)Sparsity: When Does Recovery Succeed?</a>
                            written by three of my colleagues.

                            analyzes the approximation power of neural networks that use the ReLU activation function. We analyze how deep and wide such a neural network needs to be, in order
                            to approximate any "piecewise smooth" function. We also show that these bounds are sharp.
