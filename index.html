                    <h3> Research interests </h3>

                    I am interested in Functional analysis and Harmonic analysis, in particular in

                    <ul>
                        <li> Function spaces and their embeddings </li>
                        <li> Multiscale systems (wavelets, shearlets and generalizations) </li>
                        <li> Banach frames and atomic decompositions </li>
                        <li> Approximation theory, in particular the approximation properties of multiscale systems</li>
                        <li> Coorbit theory </li>
                        <li> Time-frequency analysis </li>
                        <li> Fourier analysis </li>
                    </ul>

                    As a mathematical hobby, I am interested in almost everything related to measure theory and in trying to crack toy problems
                    like <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1552990/is-it-possible-to-characterize-completeness-of-a-normed-vector-space-by-converge">this one</a> (which is solved by now).

                    <h3> Biography </h3>

                    <p> I am a Postdoctoral researcher in the Applied Functional Analysis group at TU Berlin, part of the group of Gitta Kutyniok. </p>

                    <p> I studied mathematics (Bachelor + Master) and computer science (Bachelor) at RWTH Aachen University, Germany, where I graduated with the Master degree with distinction in 2013.</p>

                    <p>As a Ph.D. student, I then joined the group of Hartmut F√ºhr at RWTH Aachen University, where I studied the approximation theoretic properties of different multiscale systems.
                    With my Ph.D. thesis <em>'Embedding Theorems for Decomposition Spaces with applications to Wavelet Coorbit Spaces'</em>, I graduated with distinction in November 2015.
                    In November 2016, I was awarded the <a href="http://www.mathematik.rwth-aachen.de/cms/Mathematik/Forschung/Auszeichnungen/~gskt/Friedrich-Wilhelm-Preis/?lidx=1">Friedrich-Wilhelm-Award 2016</a>
                    for my thesis.
                    </p>

                    <p> I highly enjoy teaching mathematics and am committed to explaining carefully and presenting the material in an enjoyable way.
                    At RWTH Aachen University, I have been teaching assistant for Analysis I and III, and for Harmonic analysis.
                    Therefore, I am very proud to have received the <a href="https://www.fsmpi.rwth-aachen.de/studium/lehrpreise/">Teaching award of the student council of mathematics at RWTH Aachen University</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>Since April 2016 I am a postdoctoral researcher at TU Berlin, where I am working on the <a href="http://dedale.cosmostat.org/">DEDALE</a> project.</p>

                            <p>I just added to my list of publications two <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03576">new</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05289">preprints</a> that I recently uploaded to the arXiv.</p>
                            <p>
                            The first one establishes a rather general version of <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PricesTheorem.html">Price's theorem</a>: It gives a simple formula
                            for computing the partial derivatives of the map œÅ ‚Ü¶ ùîº[g(X·µ®)], where X·µ® is a normally distributed random variable with covariance matrix œÅ. Price published
                            this result in 1958, but did not precisely state the required assumptions on g. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03576">the paper</a>, I show that one
                            can in fact take every tempered distribution g.
                            This result is used in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04952">‚Ñì¬π-Analysis Minimization and Generalized (Co-)Sparsity: When Does Recovery Succeed?</a>
                            written by three of my colleagues.

                            The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05289">second preprint</a>, written jointly with my colleague

                            analyzes the approximation power of neural networks that use the ReLU activation function. We analyze how deep and wide such a neural network needs to be, in order
                            to approximate any "piecewise smooth" function. We also show that these bounds are sharp.

                            I also added several talks that I gave in the last months, including the

                            for the lecture series "Sparsity Properties of Frames via Decomposition Spaces"
                            that I gave at the <a href="http://anarm.dima.unige.it/genova2017/">Summer School on Applied Harmonic Analysis</a> in Genova.

                            (about whether completeness of spaces can be characterized by the convergence of Neumann series) has been solved (negatively) quite a while ago.
