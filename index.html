                    <h3> Biography </h3>

                    <p>
                        Since November 2021, I am a professor of mathematics (professorship Reliable Machine Learning)
                        at the newly founded <a href="https://www.ku.de/mgf/mathematik/mathematisches-institut-fuer-maschinelles-lernen-und-data-science">Mathematical Institute for Machine Learning and Data Science</a>
                        of the <a href="https://www.ku.de/en">KU Eichstätt-Ingolstadt</a>.
                        I am currently based in Eichstätt, but the institute and my group will move to Ingolstadt in 2022.
                    </p>

                    <p>From June 2021 through October 2021, I was an <a href="https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/individual/emmy_noether/">Emmy Noether independent junior research group leader</a> at the <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/">TU Munich</a>, associated to the group of <a href="https://www-m15.ma.tum.de/Allgemeines/FelixKrahmer">Felix Krahmer</a>,
                    funded through my project <a href="https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/ai-initiative/enp_projects/index.html">Stability and Solvability in Deep Learning</a>.</p>
                    

                    <p>From June 2020 until May 2021, I was a Senior Scientist in the <a href="https://mathematik.univie.ac.at/en/">Department of Mathematics</a> at the University of Vienna, part of the group of <a href="https://mat.univie.ac.at/~grohs/">Philipp Grohs</a>.</p>

                    <p>Before that, from February 2018 to May 2020, I worked as an "Akademischer Rat" as part of the <a href="https://www.ku.de/en/mgf/mathematics/scientific-computing/team-of-the-department-of-scientific-computing">Scientific Computing Group</a> at KU Eichstätt, lead by <a href="https://www.ku.de/en/mgf/mathematics/scientific-computing/team-of-the-department-of-scientific-computing/prof-dr-goetz-pfander#c4691">Götz Pfander</a>.</p>

                    <p>From April 2016 until January 2018, I was a postdoctoral researcher at TU Berlin in the group of <a href="https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=JHs9LssAAAAJ&hl=en">Gitta Kutyniok</a>, where I worked on the <a href="http://dedale.cosmostat.org/">DEDALE</a> project.
                    As part of that project, and with support by <a href="http://annepein.com/">Anne Pein</a>, I developed the <a href="https://github.com/dedale-fet/alpha-transform">DEDALE α-shearlet transform</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p>As a Ph.D. student, I worked in the group of <a href="http://www.matha.rwth-aachen.de/en/mitarbeiter/fuehr/">Hartmut Führ</a> at RWTH Aachen University, where I studied the approximation theoretic properties of different multiscale systems.
                    With my Ph.D. thesis <em>'Embedding Theorems for Decomposition Spaces with applications to Wavelet Coorbit Spaces'</em>, I graduated with distinction in November 2015.
                    In November 2016, I was awarded the <a href="http://www.mathematik.rwth-aachen.de/cms/Mathematik/Forschung/Auszeichnungen/~gskt/Friedrich-Wilhelm-Preis/?lidx=1">Friedrich-Wilhelm-Award 2016</a>
                    for my thesis.
                    </p>

                    <p>I studied mathematics (Bachelor + Master) and computer science (Bachelor) at <a href="http://www.rwth-aachen.de/">RWTH Aachen University</a>, Germany, where I graduated with the Master degree with distinction in 2013.</p>

                    <p> I highly enjoy teaching mathematics and am committed to explaining carefully and presenting the material in an enjoyable way.
                    At RWTH Aachen University, I have been teaching assistant for Analysis I and III, and for Harmonic analysis.
                    Therefore, I am very proud to have received the <a href="https://www.mathematik.rwth-aachen.de/cms/Mathematik/Forschung/Auszeichnungen/~gslc/AbsolventenTag-Mathematik-Lehrpreise/">Teaching award of the student council of mathematics at RWTH Aachen University</a>.

                            Added two papers.
                            In the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09363">first one</a>,
                            <a href="https://www.ku.de/mgf/mathematik/wissenschaftliches-rechnen/personen-des-lehrstuhls/andrei-caragea">Andrei Caragea</a>,
                            <a href="http://www.pc-petersen.eu/">Philipp Petersen</a>,
                            and I study the performance of neural networks
                            for high-dimensional classification problems with structured class boundaries.
                            In a nutshell, we show that if these boundaries are locally of Barron-type,
                            then one obtains learning and approximation bounds with rates independent of the underlying dimension.
                            <br>
                            In the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03351">second one</a>,
                            I generalize the classical <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0893-6080(05)80131-5">universal approximation theorem</a>
                            to the setting of complex-valued neural networks.
                            Under very mild continuity assumptions on the activation function, I show for shallow networks that universality holds
                            if and only if the real- or the imaginary part of the activation function is not polyharmonic.
                            For networks with at least two hidden layers, universality holds if and only if the activation function
                            is neither a polynomial, nor holomorphic, nor antiholomorphic.
                            <br>
                            Added two talks, one of which is available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daozFxwiD5s">Youtube</a>.<br>

                            <p>After my talk about the approximation properties of ReLU neural networks at the <a href="https://ins.uni-bonn.de/group/burstedde/page/seminar">Research seminar "Mathematics of Computation"</a>, I was asked for the slides to my talk.

                            <p>I just added to my list of publications two <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03576">new</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05289">preprints</a> that I recently uploaded to the arXiv.</p>

                            The first one establishes a rather general version of <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PricesTheorem.html">Price's theorem</a>: It gives a simple formula
                            for computing the partial derivatives of the map ρ ↦ 𝔼[g(Xᵨ)], where Xᵨ is a normally distributed random variable with covariance matrix ρ. Price published
                            this result in 1958, but did not precisely state the required assumptions on g. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03576">the paper</a>, I show that one
                            can in fact take every tempered distribution g.
                            This result is used in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.04952">ℓ¹-Analysis Minimization and Generalized (Co-)Sparsity: When Does Recovery Succeed?</a>
                            written by three of my colleagues.

                            analyzes the approximation power of neural networks that use the ReLU activation function.
                            We analyze how deep and wide such a neural network needs to be, in order
                            to approximate any "piecewise smooth" function. We also show that these bounds are sharp.

                            I also added several talks that I gave in the last months, including the

                            that I gave at the <a href="http://anarm.dima.unige.it/genova2017/">Summer School on Applied Harmonic Analysis</a> in Genoa.

                            (about whether completeness of spaces can be characterized by the convergence of Neumann series) has been solved (negatively) quite a while ago.
